**Project Description: Zomato Data Analysis**

**Overview:**
The project aims to analyze data from Zomato, a popular restaurant discovery and food delivery platform. Zomato provides extensive data on restaurants, user reviews, menus, and more across various cities globally. This analysis will focus on extracting meaningful insights to understand restaurant trends, customer preferences, and factors influencing ratings.

**Objectives:**
1. **Data Collection:** Gather data from Zomato using their public APIs or by scraping their website.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Cleanse and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform exploratory analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in the data. Explore variables such as restaurant ratings, cuisine types, cost factors, etc.
4. **Factors Influencing Ratings:** Identify key factors (e.g., cuisine type, cost, location) influencing restaurant ratings using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.
   
**Tools and Technologies:**
- Python: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn for plotting graphs and charts.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or spaCy for sentiment analysis.

**Deliverables:**
- Jupyter Notebook documenting the entire analysis process, from data collection to insights.
- Visualizations (charts, maps) to illustrate findings.
- Summary report outlining key insights, trends, and recommendations based on the analysis.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Identification of popular cuisines, pricing trends, and factors influencing restaurant ratings.
- Insights into customer preferences and sentiments towards different types of restaurants.

**Conclusion:**
The project will provide valuable insights into the restaurant industry through the lens of Zomato's data, offering actionable recommendations and a deeper understanding of customer behavior and preferences in the food service sector.
